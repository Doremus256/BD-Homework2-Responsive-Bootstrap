This is a website we created for Homework#2. The goal was to match the required formatting, as well as make the page responsive for different screens. I have my content fill the whole screen on anything smaller than "XS", and included a margin for screens "XS" size and above. I used classes and id's to hook CSS into individual elements in my HTML. 

I added tab functionality to my images for ADA compliance

This may work as a template for trying out different elements, especially JavaScript, as we get further into class. Eventually I can use this page as a portfolio to show off to prospective employers. 

The sticky footer at the bottom says "Hire Me" this is a joke and will change if I ever send this to employers.
